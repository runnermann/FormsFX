# Branched from FormsFX

**Modified from the Awesome FormsFX: This modification allows the transverse of a REGEX evaluation. IE for the evaluation of repeated letters occuring more than twice, the REGEX may be set to false when the needed outcome for a match is false. **

See the DemoModel which has modified the passwordField to evaluate the users password for strong password settings. 
IE for at least one uppercase, one lowercase, one numeric, one special character, and no repeating characters more than twice.

Also, the CSS file is modified for the password field to remove the password fields "Focus" glowing blue highlight in Modela CSS. See the example at the bottom of the CSS file. 




**Forms for business application made easy. Creating forms in Java has never been this easy!**
